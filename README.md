# topic-modeling-scientific-literature

This repository provides a gist on how to leverage topic modeling on
scientific literature (PDF papers).

I recommend doing the procedure illustrated here before conducting a
systematic or scoping literature review in order to increase the eyesight
of what you as a researcher should expect to see as topics that surround the
papers under investigation.

To illustrate the procedure, I collected some papers in three well-known search
engines for scientific articles, namely Web of Science, Scopus and IEEE.
In `/data`, you can find the queries used in each search engine, as well as the
exported metadata. I cannot provide the results PDFs due to copyright issues.

Feel free to explore the topics behind the scientific literature  that you are
interested in , and please interact in some way (open an issue, give some
feedback, or suggest on what this repo could be improved).
