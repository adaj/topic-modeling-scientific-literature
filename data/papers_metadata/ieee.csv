As a consequence, they have attracted unprecedented attention on social media. Besides genuine discussions and legitimate investment initiatives, several deceptive activities have flourished. In this work, we chart the online cryptocurrency landscape across multiple platforms. To reach our goal, we collected a large dataset, composed of more than 50M messages published by almost 7M users on Twitter, Telegram and Discord, over three months. We performed bot detection on Twitter accounts sharing invite links to Telegram and Discord channels, and we discovered that more than 56% of them were bots or suspended accounts. Then, we applied topic modeling techniques to Telegram and Discord messages, unveiling two different deception schemes - “pump-and-dump” and “Ponzi” - and identifying the channels involved in these frauds. Whereas on Discord we found a negligible level of deception, on Telegram we retrieved 296 channels involved in pump-and-dump and 432 involved in Ponzi schemes, accounting for a striking 20% of the total. Moreover, we observed that 93% of the invite links shared by Twitter bots point to Telegram pump-and-dump channels, shedding light on a little-known social bot activity. Charting the landscape of online cryptocurrency manipulation can inform actionable policies to fight such abuse.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3003370","Air Force Office of Scientific Research (AFOSR)(grant numbers:FA9550-17-1-0327); Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA)(grant numbers:W911NF-17-C-0094,D16AP00115); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9120022","Cryptocurrency manipulation;social bots;Twitter;Telegram;Discord","Twitter;Bitcoin;Ecosystems;Investment","cryptocurrencies;fraud;investment;social networking (online)","deceptive activities;online cryptocurrency landscape;bot detection;Twitter accounts;invite links;Discord channels;suspended accounts;Discord messages;Ponzi schemes;Twitter bots;little-known social bot activity;online cryptocurrency manipulation;attractive markets;financial speculation;social media;legitimate investment initiatives;deception schemes;Telegram pump-and-dump channels","","2","","63","CCBY","18 Jun 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Although Twitter hashtags allow to aggregate topic-related content, a specific mechanism for financial information also exists: Cashtag (consisting of the company ticker preceded by $) is a supporting mechanism to track financial tweets referring to a company listed in a stock market. However, according to our experiments and due to the lack of conventions in cashtags usage, the irruption of cryptocurrencies has resulted in a significant degradation on the cashtag-based aggregation of posts. Unfortunately, Twitter' users may use homonym tickers to refer to cryptocurrencies and to companies in stock markets, which means that filtering by cashtag may result on both posts referring to stock companies and cryptocurrencies. This research proposes automated classifiers to distinguish conflicting cashtags and, so, their container tweets by analyzing the distinctive features of tweets referring to stock companies and cryptocurrencies. As experiment, this paper analyses the interference between cryptocurrencies and company tickers in the London Stock Exchange (LSE), specifically, companies in the main and alternative market indices FTSE-100 and AIM-100. Heuristic-based as well as supervised classifiers are proposed and their advantages and drawbacks, including their ability to self-adapt to Twitter usage changes, are discussed. The experiment confirms a significant distortion in collected data when colliding or homonym cashtags exist, i.e., the same $ acronym to refer to company tickers and cryptocurrencies. According to our results, the distinctive features of posts including cryptocurrencies or company tickers support accurate classification of colliding tweets (homonym cashtags) and Independent Models, as the most detached classifiers from training data, have the potential to be trans-applicability (in different stock markets) while retaining performance.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2973735","European Regional Development Fund; Atlantic Research Center for Information and Communication Technologies; Ministerio de Economía y Competitividad(grant numbers:TEC2014-54335-C4-3-R,TEC2017-84197-C4-2-R); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8998217","AIM-100;cashtags;cryptocurrencies;data analysis;FTSE-100;london stock exchange;support vector machines;twitter","Twitter;Companies;Cryptography;Stock markets;Tagging;Telecommunications","cryptocurrencies;financial data processing;information filtering;pattern classification;social networking (online);stock markets;supervised learning","company ticker;London stock exchange;homonym cashtags;financial markets;financial information;financial tweets;stock market;stock companies;Twitter cashtags;cryptocurrencies irruption;cashtag-based aggregation;information filtering;LSE;supervised classifiers","","","","37","CCBY","13 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Our work focuses on screen event frequency analysis, which is one of the most popular forms of data gathering in mobile app analytics. We propose a privacy-preserving version of such analysis using differential privacy (DP), a popular principled approach for creating privacy-preserving analyses. We describe how DP can be introduced in screen event frequency analysis for mobile apps, and demonstrate an instance of this approach for Android apps and the Google Analytics framework.

One threat which continues to grow in the danger it poses to cyber security are botnets. Botnets can launch massive Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks against internet connected hosts anonymously, undertake intricate spam campaigns, launch mass financial fraud campaigns, and even manipulate public opinion via social media bots. The network topology and technology undergirding each botnet varies greatly, as do the motivations commonly behind such networks. Furthermore, as botnets have continued to evolve, many newer ones demonstrate increased levels of anonymity and sophistication, making it more difficult to effectively counter them. Increases in the production of vulnerable Internet of Things (IoT) devices has made it easier for malicious actors to quickly assemble sizable botnets. Because of this, the steps necessary to stop botnets also vary, and in some cases, it may be extremely difficult to effectively defeat a fully functional and sophisticated botnet. While in some cases, the infrastructure supporting the botnet can be targeted and remotely disabled, other cases require the physical assistance of law enforcement to shut down the botnet. In the latter case, it is often a significant challenge to cheaply end a botnet. On the other hand, there are many steps and mitigations that can be taken by end-users to prevent their own devices from becoming part of a botnet. Many of these solutions involve implementing basic cybersecurity practices like installing firewalls and changing default passwords. More sophisticated botnets may require similarly sophisticated intrusion detection systems, to detect and remove malicious infections. Much research has gone into such systems and in recent years many researchers have begun to implement machine learning techniques to defeat botnets. This paper is intended present a review on botnet evolution, trends and mitigations, and offer related examples and research to provide the reader with quick access to a broad understanding of the issues at hand.","","978-1-7281-1380-7","10.1109/SPIN.2019.8711780","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8711780","botnets;cybersecurity;Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks;Internet of Things (IoT) devices","Botnet;Computer crime;Task analysis;Internet of Things;IP networks","computer network security;fraud;Internet;Internet of Things;invasive software;learning (artificial intelligence);social networking (online)","fully functional botnet;sophisticated botnet;cyber systems;botnets security threats;distributed denial of service attacks;DDoS attacks;Internet connected hosts anonymously;social media bots;undertake intricate spam campaigns;launch mass financial fraud campaigns;network topology;Internet of Things devices;IoT devices;sophisticated intrusion detection systems;machine learning techniques;public opinion","","5","","60","","13 May 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

For processing, organizations must first store this data. Of the few data storage options that satisfy the characteristics to reserve streams of data, NoSQL databases provide a better alternative because of their ability to stored schema-less data which was not possible in RDBMS. Among these, two databases in Elasticsearch and Cassandra have been chosen to demonstrate their performance when tested against a streaming application. The performance comparison is carried out on the basis of Data Manipulation Language operations on both NoSQL datastores. Based on the experiment conducted, it is concluded that higher scalability operations were performed faster by Cassandra while Elasticsearch took smaller execution time for applications that required aggregations and modifications of data. The analysis done thus helps organizations chose the appropriate NoSQL database for their own requirements.","","978-1-5386-5257-2","10.1109/ICCUBEA.2018.8697482","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8697482","NoSQL databases;Streaming Data;Elasticsearch;Apache Cassandra;Performance analysis;DML Operations;Big Data","NoSQL databases;Big Data;Peer-to-peer computing;Scalability;Python;Computer architecture","data handling;database management systems;NoSQL databases;social networking (online)","NoSQL databases;streaming data;security analysis;social media analysis;data storage options;streaming application;performance comparison;NoSQL datastores;NoSQL database;DML operations performance analysis;schema-less data;data manipulation language operations","","","","20","","25 Apr 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The internet has gone beyond institutions and organizations to provide a different service and there have been attempts to provide services only through the internet and thus to earn money. It can also be a organization or an individual who opens an account on the social network and provides financial gain on these accounts. The financial gain on the internet is increasing in parallel with the number of people entering the site in general or the number of people reading the content on the site. Clickbait is a click technique in which a user manipulates the curiosity of a person in order to open more pages in a web site, usually by writing exaggerated and unreal headlines. In this study, headlines or subheadings for news were collected. In these news articles, the Clickbait headline identified by TF-IDF has summarized by looking at the content of the Clickbait news with text feature extraction based on ontology method. The summarized version has been shown to the user without having to click on the newsletter. In this study, news in 4 news sites with Turkish and English content were examined. This study is the first Turkish study about Clickbait detection. In the English tests, results have given in comparison with equivalent algorithms and explained in detail.","2473-991X","978-1-5386-6051-5","10.1109/ASONAM.2018.8508452","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8508452","clickbait;news;web;curiosity;TF-IDF","Feature extraction;Twitter;Media;Organizations;Reliability;Web pages","advertising data processing;feature extraction;information resources;Internet;ontologies (artificial intelligence);social networking (online);text analysis","Web site;news sites;Clickbait detection;Internet;text feature extraction;Turkish content;English content;social network;ontology method;Clickbait news;Clickbait headline;news articles","","1","","23","","25 Oct 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"Byzantine-Resilient Secure Federated Learning","J. So; B. Güler; A. S.

This is achieved through an iterative process where, at each iteration, users update a global model using their local datasets. Each user then masks its local update via random keys, and the masked models are aggregated at a central server to compute the global model for the next iteration. As the local updates are protected by random masks, the server cannot observe their true values. This presents a major challenge for the resilience of the model against adversarial (Byzantine) users, who can manipulate the global model by modifying their local updates or datasets. Towards addressing this challenge, this paper presents the first single-server Byzantine-resilient secure aggregation framework (BREA) for secure federated learning. BREA is based on an integrated stochastic quantization, verifiable outlier detection, and secure model aggregation approach to guarantee Byzantine-resilience, privacy, and convergence simultaneously. We provide theoretical convergence and privacy guarantees and characterize the fundamental trade-offs in terms of the network size, user dropouts, and privacy protection. Our experiments demonstrate convergence in the presence of Byzantine users, and comparable accuracy to conventional federated learning benchmarks.","1558-0008","","10.1109/JSAC.2020.3041404","Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA)(grant numbers:HR001117C0053); Army Research Office (ARO)(grant numbers:W911NF1810400); NSF(grant numbers:CCF-1703575,CCF-1763673); Office of Naval Research (ONR)(grant numbers:N00014-16-1-2189); research gifts from Intel and Facebook; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9276464","Federated learning;privacy-preserving machine learning;Byzantine-resilience;distributed training in mobile networks","Training;Privacy;Quantization (signal);Protocols;Computational modeling;Collaborative work;Robustness","data privacy;iterative methods;learning (artificial intelligence);stochastic processes","random keys;central server;iteration;random masks;adversarial users;single-server Byzantine-resilient secure aggregation framework;secure model;Byzantine-resilience;privacy guarantees;user dropouts;privacy protection;Byzantine users;Byzantine-resilient secure federated learning;privacy-preserving framework;machine learning models;mobile users;iterative process;federated learning benchmarks;convergence;stochastic quantization","","6","","44","IEEE","2 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
