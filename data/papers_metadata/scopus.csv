The possibility to access open, real-time data about stock market information and firms’ public reputation can bring competitive advantages to industry insiders. However, as many studies extensively demonstrated before, manipulative campaigns by social bots do not spare the financial sector either. In this work, we show that the more viral a stock is on Twitter, the more that virality is artificially caused by social bots. This result is also confirmed when considering accounts suspended by Twitter instead of bots. Starting from this finding, we then propose two methods for detecting the presence and the extent of financial disinformation on Twitter, via classification and regression. Our systems exploit hundreds of features to encode the characteristics of viral discussions, including features about: participating users, textual content of shared posts, temporal patterns of diffusion, and financial information about stocks. We experiment with different combinations of algorithms and features, achieving excellent results for the detection of financial disinformation (F1=0.97) and promising results for the challenging task of estimating the extent of inorganic activity within financial discussions (R2=0.81, MAE=4.9%). Our compelling results pave the way for the deployment of novel systems for protecting against financial disinformation. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Disinformation; Financial spam; Social bots; Twitter","Botnet; Competition; Social networking (online); Competitive advantage; Financial information; Financial sectors; Market information; Real-time data; Social media; Temporal pattern; Textual content; Finance",Article,"Final","",Scopus

The anonymity surrounding these currencies makes investors particularly susceptible to fraudity - such as 'pump and dump' scams - where the goal is to artificially inflate the perceived worth of a currency, luring victims into investing before the fraudsters can sell their holdings. Because of the speed and relative anonymity offered by social platforms such as Twitter and Telegram, social media has become a preferred platform for scammers who wish to spread false hype about the cryptocurrency they are trying to pump. In this work, we propose and evaluate a computational approach that can automatically identify pump and dump scams as they unfold by combining information across social media platforms. We also develop a multi-modal approach for predicting whether a particular pump attempt will succeed or not. Finally, we analyze the prevalence of bots in cryptocurrency related tweets, and observe a significant increase in bot activity during the pump attempts. © 2014 IEEE.","Anomaly detection; cryptocurrency; pump and dump; social media data mining","Cryptocurrency; Pumps; Computational approach; Financial transactions; Fraudsters; Multi-modal approach; Social media; Social media platforms; Virtual currency; Social networking (online)",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus

OSNs alter how people communicate, make decisions, and form or change their beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors. Thus, they can now impact social groups, financial systems, and political communication at scale. As one type of OSN, social media platforms, such as Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube, serve as outlets for users to convey information to an audience as broad or targeted as the user desires. Over the years, these social media platforms have been infected with automated accounts, or bots, that are capable of hijacking conversations, influencing other users, and manipulating content dissemination. Although benign bots exist to facilitate legitimate activities, we focus on bots designed to perform malicious acts through social media platforms. Bots that mimic the social behaviors of humans are referred to as social bots. Social bots help automate sociotechnical behaviors, such as ``liking'' tweets, tweeting/retweeting a message, following users, and coordinating with or even competing against other bots. Some advanced social bots exhibit highly sophisticated traits of coordination and communication with complex organizational structures. This article presents a detailed survey of social bots, their types and behaviors, and how they impact social media, identification algorithms, and their coordination strategies in OSNs. The survey also discusses coordination in areas such as biological systems, interorganizational networks, and coordination games. Existing research extensively studied bot detection, but bot coordination is still emerging and requires more in-depth analysis. The survey covers existing techniques and open research issues on the analysis of social bots, their behaviors, and how social network theories can be leveraged to assess coordination during online campaigns.

This echoing further boosts the spread to regions substantially larger than the initial region. These spreading accounts can be actual humans or social bots. Design/methodology/approach: The paper reveals an interesting anomaly in information cascades in Twitter and proposes the spreading group model that explains this anomaly. The model was tested using an agent-based simulation, real Twitter data and questionnaires. Findings: The messages of few anonymous Twitter accounts spread on average more than well-known global financial media groups, such as The Wall Street Journal or Bloomberg. The spreading groups (also sometimes called BotNets) model provides an effective mechanism that can explain these findings. Research limitations/implications: Spreading groups are only one possible mechanism that can explain the effectiveness of spread of tweets from lesser known accounts. The implication of this work is in showing how spreading groups can be used as a mechanism to spread messages in social networks. The construction of spreading groups is rather technical and does not require using opinion leaders. Similar to the case of “Fake News,” we expect the topic of spreading groups and their aim to manipulate information to receive growing attention in public discussion. Practical implications: While harnessing opinion leaders to spread messages is costly, constructing spreading groups is more technical and replicable. Spreading groups are an efficient method to amplify the spread of message in social networks. Social implications: With the blossoming of fake news, one might tend to assess the reliability of news by the number of users involved in its spread. This heuristic might be easily fooled by spreading groups. Furthermore, spreading groups consisting of a blend of human and computerized bots might be hard to detect. They can be used to manipulate financial markets or political campaigns. Originality/value: The paper demonstrates an anomaly in Twitter that was not studied before. It proposes a novel approach to spreading messages in social networks. The methods presented in the paper are valuable for anyone interested in spreading messages or an agenda such as political actors or other agenda enthusiasts. While social bots have been widely studied, their synchronization to increase the spread is novel. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","BotNets; Fake news; Information spread; Social networks; Spreading groups; Viral marketing","Botnet; Commerce; Financial markets; Surveys; Botnets; Fake news; Information spread; Spreading groups; Viral marketing; Social networking (online); article; attention; disinformation; human; human experiment; leadership; marketing; questionnaire; reliability; simulation; social network; transcription initiation",Article,"Final","",Scopus

As a consequence, they have attracted unprecedented attention on social media. Besides genuine discussions and legitimate investment initiatives, several deceptive activities have flourished. In this work, we chart the online cryptocurrency landscape across multiple platforms. To reach our goal, we collected a large dataset, composed of more than 50M messages published by almost 7M users on Twitter, Telegram and Discord, over three months. We performed bot detection on Twitter accounts sharing invite links to Telegram and Discord channels, and we discovered that more than 56% of them were bots or suspended accounts. Then, we applied topic modeling techniques to Telegram and Discord messages, unveiling two different deception schemes - 'pump-and-dump' and 'Ponzi' - and identifying the channels involved in these frauds. Whereas on Discord we found a negligible level of deception, on Telegram we retrieved 296 channels involved in pump-and-dump and 432 involved in Ponzi schemes, accounting for a striking 20% of the total. Moreover, we observed that 93% of the invite links shared by Twitter bots point to Telegram pump-and-dump channels, shedding light on a little-known social bot activity.

Although Twitter hashtags allow to aggregate topic-related content, a specific mechanism for financial information also exists: Cashtag (consisting of the company ticker preceded by $) is a supporting mechanism to track financial tweets referring to a company listed in a stock market. However, according to our experiments and due to the lack of conventions in cashtags usage, the irruption of cryptocurrencies has resulted in a significant degradation on the cashtag-based aggregation of posts. Unfortunately, Twitter' users may use homonym tickers to refer to cryptocurrencies and to companies in stock markets, which means that filtering by cashtag may result on both posts referring to stock companies and cryptocurrencies. This research proposes automated classifiers to distinguish conflicting cashtags and, so, their container tweets by analyzing the distinctive features of tweets referring to stock companies and cryptocurrencies. As experiment, this paper analyses the interference between cryptocurrencies and company tickers in the London Stock Exchange (LSE), specifically, companies in the main and alternative market indices FTSE-100 and AIM-100. Heuristic-based as well as supervised classifiers are proposed and their advantages and drawbacks, including their ability to self-adapt to Twitter usage changes, are discussed. The experiment confirms a significant distortion in collected data when colliding or homonym cashtags exist, i.e., the same $ acronym to refer to company tickers and cryptocurrencies. According to our results, the distinctive features of posts including cryptocurrencies or company tickers support accurate classification of colliding tweets (homonym cashtags) and Independent Models, as the most detached classifiers from training data, have the potential to be trans-applicability (in different stock markets) while retaining performance. © 2013 IEEE.","AIM-100; cashtags; cryptocurrencies; data analysis; FTSE-100; london stock exchange; support vector machines; twitter","Classification (of information); Cryptocurrency; Data reduction; Electronic money; Social networking (online); Support vector machines; AIM-100; cashtags; FTSE-100; London Stock Exchange; twitter; Financial markets",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus

One threat which continues to grow in the danger it poses to cyber security are botnets. Botnets can launch massive Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks against internet connected hosts anonymously, undertake intricate spam campaigns, launch mass financial fraud campaigns, and even manipulate public opinion via social media bots. The network topology and technology undergirding each botnet varies greatly, as do the motivations commonly behind such networks. Furthermore, as botnets have continued to evolve, many newer ones demonstrate increased levels of anonymity and sophistication, making it more difficult to effectively counter them. Increases in the production of vulnerable Internet of Things (IoT) devices has made it easier for malicious actors to quickly assemble sizable botnets. Because of this, the steps necessary to stop botnets also vary, and in some cases, it may be extremely difficult to effectively defeat a fully functional and sophisticated botnet. While in some cases, the infrastructure supporting the botnet can be targeted and remotely disabled, other cases require the physical assistance of law enforcement to shut down the botnet. In the latter case, it is often a significant challenge to cheaply end a botnet. On the other hand, there are many steps and mitigations that can be taken by end-users to prevent their own devices from becoming part of a botnet. Many of these solutions involve implementing basic cybersecurity practices like installing firewalls and changing default passwords. More sophisticated botnets may require similarly sophisticated intrusion detection systems, to detect and remove malicious infections. Much research has gone into such systems and in recent years many researchers have begun to implement machine learning techniques to defeat botnets. This paper is intended present a review on botnet evolution, trends and mitigations, and offer related examples and research to provide the reader with quick access to a broad understanding of the issues at hand. © 2019 IEEE.","botnets; cybersecurity; Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks; Internet of Things (IoT) devices","Denial-of-service attack; Internet of things; Intrusion detection; Laws and legislation; Learning systems; Network security; Signal processing; Social aspects; Botnets; Cyber security; Distributed denial of service attack; Internet of Things (IOT); Intrusion Detection Systems; Machine learning techniques; Network topology; Security threats; Botnet",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus

For example, bots have been used to sway political elections by distorting online discourse, to manipulate the stock market, or to push anti-vaccine conspiracy theories that may have caused health epidemics. Most techniques proposed to date detect bots at the account level, by processing large amounts of social media posts, and leveraging information from network structure, temporal dynamics, sentiment analysis, etc. In this paper, we propose a deep neural network based on contextual long short-term memory (LSTM) architecture that exploits both content and metadata to detect bots at the tweet level: contextual features are extracted from user metadata and fed as auxiliary input to LSTM deep nets processing the tweet text. Another contribution that we make is proposing a technique based on synthetic minority oversampling to generate a large labeled dataset, suitable for deep nets training, from a minimal amount of labeled data (roughly 3000 examples of sophisticated Twitter bots). We demonstrate that, from just one single tweet, our architecture can achieve high classification accuracy (AUC > 96%) in separating bots from humans. We apply the same architecture to account-level bot detection, achieving nearly perfect classification accuracy (AUC > 99%).

The main motive for market surveillance is to make the market more efficient and free from rouge elements. Identification of financial rumors is vital for orderly functioning of the stock market. Social media platforms allow spread of unverified information to a large mass quickly due to their interconnected nature and large number of participating members. Due to the deluge of data over various media channels including social media, manual scanning of financial rumors is inefficient. This necessitates the use of a big data infrastructure for collection, storage, and analysis of financial news related data. In this paper, we introduce a framework for automated detection of financial rumors using big data. Our framework is based on extant research on knowledge-based discovery in databases and detection of fraudulent financial activities. We describe an in-depth descriptive case study of the world’s fastest stock exchange, the Bombay Stock Exchange. Through the case, we highlight the importance of analytics for detection of financial rumors and the importance of the big data infrastructure to carry out such a task. We identify several critical factors that lead to successful identification of financial rumors. We believe the framework can be used by market regulators, stock exchanges, and security research agencies to identify information-based market manipulation using a systematic data-driven approach over a big data infrastructure. © 2018 Taylor & Francis.","Analytics; big data; financial rumors; knowledge discovery; market manipulation; market surveillance; rumor detection; social media; stock exchange",,Article,"Final","",Scopus

These campaigns contribute to the shaping of collective opinions. While most information campaigns are benign, some may be deployed for nefarious purposes, including terrorist propaganda, political astroturf, and financial market manipulation. It is therefore important to be able to detect whether a meme is being artificially promoted at the very moment it becomes wildly popular. This problem has important social implications and poses numerous technical challenges. As a first step, here we focus on discriminating between trending memes that are either organic or promoted by means of advertisement. The classification is not trivial: ads cause bursts of attention that can be easily mistaken for those of organic trends. We designed a machine learning framework to classify memes that have been labeled as trending on Twitter. After trending, we can rely on a large volume of activity data. Early detection, occurring immediately at trending time, is a more challenging problem due to the minimal volume of activity data that is available prior to trending. Our supervised learning framework exploits hundreds of time-varying features to capture changing network and diffusion patterns, content and sentiment information, timing signals, and user meta-data. We explore different methods for encoding feature time series. Using millions of tweets containing trending hashtags, we achieve 75% AUC score for early detection, increasing to above 95% after trending. We evaluate the robustness of the algorithms by introducing random temporal shifts on the trend time series. Feature selection analysis reveals that content cues provide consistently useful signals; user features are more informative for early detection, while network and timing features are more helpful once more data is available. © 2017, The Author(s).","advertising; early detection; information campaigns; social media","Education; Marketing; Time series; Diffusion patterns; information campaigns; Market manipulation; Social implication; Social media; Technical challenges; Temporal shifts; Timing signals; Social networking (online)",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green, Gold",Scopus

The method aims to improve the CAD algorithm by capturing the expected behaviour of stocks through sentiment analysis of tweets about stocks. The extracted insights are aggregated per day for each stock and transformed to a time series. The time series is used to eliminate false positives from anomalies that are detected by CAD. We present a case study and explore developing sentiment analysis models to improve anomaly detection in the stock market. The experimental results confirm the proposed method is effective in improving CAD through removing irrelevant anomalies by correctly identifying 28% of false positives. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.",,"Commerce; Computer aided design; Data mining; Finance; Financial markets; Time series; Time series analysis; Anomaly detection; False positive; Market manipulation; Sentiment analysis; Big data",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus

Millions of social media users are exposed every day to popular memes-some generated organically by grassroots activity, others sustained by advertising, information campaigns or more or less transparent coordinated efforts. While most information campaigns are benign, some may have nefarious purposes, including terrorist propaganda, political astroturf, and financial market manipulation. This poses a crucial technological challenge with deep social implications: can we detect whether the spreading of a viral meme is being sustained by a promotional campaign? Here we study trending memes that attract attention either organically, or by means of advertisement. We designed a machine learning framework capable to detect promoted campaigns and separate them from organic ones in their early stages. Using a dataset of millions of posts associated with trending Twitter hashtags, we prove that remarkably accurate early detection is possible, achieving 95% AUC score. Feature selection analysis reveals that network diffusion patterns and content cues are powerful early detection signals. © Copyright 2016, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (www.aaai.org).
